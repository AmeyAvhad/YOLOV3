## What You Will Learn

* How to load your custom image detection data from Roboflow
* How to instatiate a pytorch YOLOv3 model
* How to train the YOLOv3 model
* How to use the trained model for quick inference
* How to save model weights for future use

## Resources 

* [This blogpost](https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-a-yolov3-object-detection-model-with-a-custom-dataset/) provides a roadmap (though it is tailored to a keras implementation)
* This notebook provides the code necessary to run the tutorial [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ntAL_zI68xfvZ4uCSAF6XT27g0U4mZbW#scrollTo=VHS_o3KGIyXm)
* For reading purposes, the notebook is also saved in Tutorial.ipynb
